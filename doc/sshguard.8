.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBsshguard\fP protects hosts from brute\-force attacks against SSH and other
services. It aggregates system logs and blocks repeat offenders using one of
several firewall backends, including \fBiptables\fP, \fBipfw\fP, and \fBpf\fP\&.
.sp
\fBsshguard\fP can read log messages from standard input (suitable for piping
from \fBsyslog\fP) or monitor one or more log files. Log messages are parsed,
line\-by\-line, for recognized patterns. If an attack, such as several login
failures within a few seconds, is detected, the offending IP is blocked.
Offenders are unblocked after a set interval, but can be semi\-permanently
banned using the blacklist option.
.sp
See \fI\%http://www.sshguard.net/docs/setup/\fP for setup instructions.
.sp
Other features, attack signatures, and additional documentation can be found
at \fI\%http://www.sshguard.net/\fP\&.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-a\fP \fIthresh\fP (default 30)
Block an attacker when its dangerousness exceeds \fIthresh\fP\&. Each attack
pattern that is matched contributes a fixed dangerousness of 10.
.TP
.B \fB\-b\fP \fIthresh\fP:\fIfile\fP
Blacklist an attacker when its dangerousness exceeds \fIthresh\fP\&.
Blacklisted addresses are added to \fIfile\fP so they can be read at the
next startup. Blacklisted addresses are never automatically unblocked,
but it is good practice to periodically clean out stale blacklist
entries.
.TP
.B \fB\-f\fP \fIservice\fP:\fIpidfile\fP
Deprecated. See LOG VALIDATION below.
.TP
.B \fB\-i\fP \fIpidfile\fP
Write the PID of \fBsshguard\fP to \fIpidfile\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-l\fP \fIsource\fP
Monitor \fIsource\fP for log messages. By default, \fBsshguard\fP reads log
messages from standard input. Give this option once for every source to
monitor instead. \fBsshguard\fP transparently handles log rotations. When
using this option, standard input is ignored, but can be re\-added by
giving \(aq\fB\-l\fP \-\(aq.
.TP
.B \fB\-p\fP \fIinterval\fP (default 120 secs, or 2 minutes)
Wait at least \fIinterval\fP seconds before releasing a blocked address.
Repeat attackers are blocked for 1.5 times longer after each attack.
Because \fBsshguard\fP unblocks attackers only at infrequent intervals,
this parameter is inexact (actual blocks will be longer).
.TP
.B \fB\-s\fP \fIinterval\fP (default 1800 secs, or 30 minutes)
Forget about an attacker \fIinterval\fP seconds after its last attempt. Its
dangerousness will be reset to zero.
.TP
.B \fB\-w\fP \fIaddress\fP | \fIfile\fP
Whitelist the given address, hostname, or address block. Alternatively,
read whitelist entires from \fIfile\fP\&. This option can be given multiple
times. See WHITELISTING below for details.
.TP
.B \fB\-v\fP
Print version information and exit.
.UNINDENT
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B SSHGUARD_DEBUG
Enable additional debugging information.
.UNINDENT
.SH WHITELISTING
.sp
\fBsshguard\fP supports address whitelisting. Whitelisted addresses are not
blocked even if they appear to generate attacks. This is useful for protecting
lame LAN users (or external friendly users) from being incidentally blocked.
.sp
Whitelist addresses are controlled through the \-w command\-line option. This
option can add explicit addresses, host names and address blocks:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B addresses
specify the numeric IPv4 or IPv6 address directly, like:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-w 192.168.1.10
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or in multiple occurrences:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-w 192.168.1.10 \-w 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B host names
specify the host name directly, like:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-w friendhost.enterprise.com
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or in multiple occurrences:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-w friendhost.enterprise.com \-w friend2.enterprise.com
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that the host resolves to are whitelisted. Hosts
are resolved to addresses once, when \fBsshguard\fP starts up.
.TP
.B address blocks
specify the IPv4 or IPv6 address block in the usual CIDR notation:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-w 2002:836b:4179::836b:0000/126
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or in multiple occurrences:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-w 192.168.0.0/24 \-w 1.2.3.128/26
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B file
When longer lists are needed for whitelisting, they can be wrapped into a
plain text file, one address/hostname/block per line, with the same syntax
given above.
.sp
\fBsshguard\fP can take whitelists from files when the \-w option argument begins
with a \(aq.\(aq (dot) or \(aq/\(aq (slash).
.sp
This is a sample whitelist file (say /etc/friends):
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# comment line (a \(aq#\(aq as very first character)
#   a single IPv4 and IPv6 address
1.2.3.4
2001:0db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7344
#   address blocks in CIDR notation
127.0.0.0/8
10.11.128.0/17
192.168.0.0/24
2002:836b:4179::836b:0000/126
#   hostnames
rome\-fw.enterprise.com
hosts.friends.com
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And this is how \fBsshguard\fP is told to make a whitelist up from the
/etc/friends file:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sshguard \-w /etc/friends
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \-w option can be used only once for files. For addresses, host names and
address blocks it can be used with any multiplicity, even with mixes of them.
.SH LOG VALIDATION
.sp
Syslog and syslog\-ng typically insert a PID of the generating process in every
log message. This can be checked for authenticating the source of the message
and avoid false attacks to be detected because malicious local users inject
crafted log messages. This way \fBsshguard\fP can be safely used even on hosts
where this assumption does not hold.
.sp
Log validation is only needed when \fBsshguard\fP is fed log messages from syslog
or from syslog\-ng. When a process logs directly to a raw file and sshguard is
configured for polling logs directly from it, you only need to adjust the log
file permissions so that only root can write on it.
.sp
For enabling log validation on a given service the \-f option is used as
follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-f 100:/var/run/sshd.pid
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
which associates the given pidfile to the ssh service (code 100). A list of
well\-known service codes is available at
\fI\%http://www.sshguard.net/docs/reference/service\-codes/\fP\&.
.sp
The \-f option can be used multiple times for associating different services with
their pidfile:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sshguard \-f 100:/var/run/sshd.pid \-f 123:/var/run/mydaemon.pid
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Services that are not configured for log validation follow a default\-allow
policy (all of their log messages are accepted by default).
.sp
PIDs are checked with the following policy:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
the logging service is searched in the list of services configured for
validation. If not found, the entry is accepted.
.IP 2. 3
the logged PID is compared with the pidfile. If it matches, the entry is
accepted
.IP 3. 3
the PID is checked for being a direct child of the authoritative process. If
it is, the entry is accepted.
.IP 4. 3
the entry is ignored.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Low I/O load is committed to the operating system because of an internal caching
mechanism. Changes in the pidfile value are handled transparently.
